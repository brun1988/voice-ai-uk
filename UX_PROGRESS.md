## How Close Are We to Matching Synthflow?

| Aspect | Synthflow | Voice AI UK | Status |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Color palette | Purple (#5b0dd5) | Blue/Purple gradient (#1877F2→#9333EA) | ⚠️ Mismatch |
| Typography (Geist) | ✅ | ✅ Added | Done |
| Interactive demo | ✅ Live audio demos | ✅ Text conversation UI | Done |
| Button styling | ✅ | ✅ Done | Done |
| Card designs | ✅ | ✅ Done | Done |
| Mobile menu | ✅ Hamburger | ✅ Implemented | Done |
| Navigation | ✅ Dropdown menus | ⚠️ Anchor links only | Partial |
| Trust signals | ✅ Real company names | ❌ Generic | Gap |

## What Still Needs Work

1. **Color Palette Alignment**: Voice AI UK uses blue (#1877F2) while Synthflow is purple (#5b0dd5). Should we stick with blue (our brand) or match Synthflow's purple?
2. **Navigation Dropdowns**: Currently only anchor links — need proper dropdown menus for Products, Solutions, Pricing
3. **Trust Signals**: Add real company logos/names for testimonials
4. **Flow Builder UI**: The core product interface (not just marketing site)
5. **Pricing Section**: Synthflow shows detailed tiered pricing — our pricing section needs work

## Specific Next Steps

1. **Decide on color strategy**: Keep blue brand or switch to Synthflow-style purple?
2. **Add dropdown navigation**: Desktop navbar with hoverdropdowns
3. **Polish testimonials**: Add company names, specific metrics
4. **Enhance pricing display**: Tier comparison table like Synthflow

## Honest Assessment

**Marketing site is ~75% there**. The interactive demo and mobile menu are major improvements. The main inconsistency is color — we're using blue while researching/pursuing Synthflow's purple palette. 

The **functionality gap** (flow builder, agent configuration UI) remains — but that's the actual product vs. a marketing site comparison.
